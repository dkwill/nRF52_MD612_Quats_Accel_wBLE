# BLE: HID Joystick

![ble_app_hids_joystick_md612](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14309815/24084556/fed7d74e-0cf4-11e7-8a1b-c86b68064d26.gif)

Adapted from ble_app_hids_mouse_md612 example.

After flashing you should see board as "Nordic_Joystick" with gamepad icon on your phone/tablet/PC.

Code contains same hardcoded calibration parameters as mouse example.
'Self-test' routine executes on startup to recalibrate accel and gyro, so, please, align board horizontally on startup to get correct calibration.
If you wish to calibrate magnetometer, you should do good '8' figure along with rotations on each axis (X, -X, Y, -Y, Z, -Z) and Invensense's implementation will update calibration for magnetometer automagically.

Also tested with GamePad API in Google Chrome.
